# Applied Machine Learning in Python
## by University of Michigan

This course introduce the learner to applied machine learning, focusing more on the techniques and methods than on the statistics behind these methods. The course start with a discussion of how machine learning is different than descriptive statistics, and introduce the scikit learn toolkit through a tutorial. The issue of dimensionality of data is be discussed, and the task of clustering data, as well as evaluating those clusters, is tackled. Supervised approaches for creating predictive models is be described, and learners are able to apply the scikit learn predictive modelling methods while understanding process issues related to data generalizability (e.g. cross validation, overfitting). The course end with a look at more advanced techniques, such as building ensembles, and practical limitations of predictive models. By the end of this course, students are able to identify the difference between a supervised (classification) and unsupervised (clustering) technique, identify which technique they need to apply for a particular dataset and need, engineer features to meet that need, and write python code to carry out an analysis.
